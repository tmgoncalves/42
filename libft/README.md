# libft

To begin, you must redo a set of functions from the libc. Your functions will have the
same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply
with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They
will begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.
